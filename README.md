# Capture-the-Ether-Solutions

These are my solutions for the Capture the Ether challange.

Some solutions are smart contracts, some are python scripts for calculation and/or sending transactions when etherscan cannot verify the source code.

If a solution only contains a README, the challenge can be solved through etherscan by following the steps inside the README.
